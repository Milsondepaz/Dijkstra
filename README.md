# Dijkstra


Dijkstra's algorithm, conceived by Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra in 1956 and published in 1959, solves the problem of the shortest path on a graph directed 
or not directed with edges of non-negative weight, in computational time O(m + n log n) where m is the number of edges and n is the number of vertices. The algorithm that 
serves to solve the same problem in a graph with negative weights is the Bellman-Ford algorithm, which has a longer runtime than Dijkstra.

In this project i developed a simple Java Application that solves the problem of walking using the Dijkstra algorithm
